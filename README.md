# TipoAI ChemLab - Properties Predictions
Deep learning is a very great way to analyse big amounts of data, so we thought if we chould make a model that can predict molecular properties and implement this in some sort of web application where everyone has access, students, scientists and so on. We belive that this is the beginning of our project "ChemLab". We have a vision of one single platform with all the necessary chemistry tools needed, everything from Molecular Properties Predictions to Retrosynthesis, this will be a big project that we will put much of our free time on so fell free to support us, more information under Support.

# Dataset

So we tried to find the best datasets, we will start by developing the properties prediction system, so we will only need the SMILES, chemical formulas for molecules and we had some alternatives when we looked for good datasets. But we decided to use the GDB because we only need the smiles at the moment becuase we will use RDKit to find the properties of the SMILES. So we will first try GDB-11 that has about 65 000 parameters and if thats not a problem we will go on to GDB-13 that has 1.5 million parameters and can predict molecules with 13 atoms.
